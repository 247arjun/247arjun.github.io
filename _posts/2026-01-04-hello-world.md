# Hello, World!

Having pivoted my career from Individual Contributor Security Engineer to Security Engineering Manager in 2024, I have had the good fortune of learning (in an environment that affords me that privilege and luxury) so much about engineering management in general, and security engineering management in particular. 

When I started my management career, there weren't many sources of knowledge to consume to understand my new role; I relied on the kindness and generosity of my colleagues who shared unreservedly, building on their experiences and methods. 

That said, I do wish there were chronicled words of wisdom and knowledge that I could also consume to form my own mental models of this path. Security engineering is quite a different beast compared to traditional software engineering, and management within the field even more so. 
> For instance, you are never "done" with a problem or class of problems; you asymptote towards "done" and move on, trusting that the remaining juice isn't worth the squeeze, ensuring that other defense in depth measures will come into play.

I will attempt to capture my thoughts and learnings, either in near-realtime or retrospectively, here on my blog. Both to serve as my own chronicling as well as to share broader.

Strap in, 2026 just started and I couldn't be more excited for the year ahead.

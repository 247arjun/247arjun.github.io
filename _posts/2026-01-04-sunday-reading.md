# Sunday Reading

I am a voracious reader, vastly preferring textual content to video. My most used app on my phone and tablet are my RSS reader (I have a curated set of feeds that I've compiled over the years). It's safe to say that if you see me relaxing in front of a small screen, I'm reading something. 

This habit (hobby?) extends to all days of the week, including weekends; my mind is most at rest when it's learning. Now there generally isn't a lot of news happening on weekends, but the weekends are when some of my favorite reads are published, often from working people who enjoy writing as a hobby.

Two such sources of content that I look forward to every Sunday straddle both of my current areas of specialty at work: Cloud Security and Management. 

The [CloudSecList](https://cloudseclist.com/) newsletter is the best way to stay on top of the cloud security landscape without being overwhelmed by all the noise.

The [Blog for Engineering Managers](https://www.blog4ems.com/) publishes a "Sunday Reads for EMs" every Sunday that compile articles from multiple other blogs, with some great content usually making the cut. 

What other content do you read, especially on weekends?

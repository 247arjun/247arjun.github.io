# It's time to build (together)

Scratching your own itch for tooling just became so much easier with GenAI. 

With minimal effort and maximal curiosity (and some prompt-fu), I've seen engineers on our team solve problems that would've never been worth investing in bespoke solutions. Each of these work for their unique mental models and individual ways of working. 

For my own consumption, mostly vibe coded (but architecturally understood and debugged), I've built things I've wanted for years. 

I've built myself a GUI for cURL (frees me up from having to memorize its command line args), a VS Code extension for Azure DevOps (to see ADO Boards query results with minimal UI), an RSS Reader on macOS (that includes Apple Foundation Models summarization), multiple MCP Servers for common CLI utilities (grep, jq, curl).

If there's one thing I'm convinced of with this renaissance of software development (not coding, but actually developing software solutions) is the opportunity to build together.

# Moti... wait a minute!

I am getting the opportunity to get a few management training sessions with EZRA, and in my conversation today, motivation came up. 

I am very motivated in my job. I love what I do, I wouldn't trade it for anything else both from a technical standpoint and people-management standpoint. I want to do my best to ensure the rest of our team feels equally motivated and energized by our work.

> Do unto others...

When speaking to my coach today about this, she asked me a simple question that left me somewhat speechless. She asked, "What have been your most positive and memorable experiences with your managers"? I immediately had answers, spanning multiple managers over the years, recalling instances in great detail even many years later.

The part left unsaid by my coach was that to answer my question, I already had the answers from my own experiences. 

As a follow up exercise for myself, I asked ChatGPT "As an engineering manager I want to motivate my team to strive for excellence. Reference psychology and tell me what motivates humans, and give me examples of how I can use that to motivate", not as a cheat sheet but to understand the underlying psychology. What was interesting is how I read through the list twice, once from how I could adopt that for the team and a second time on how I could look for my own manager modeling the same behavior with me.
